## Chess Timer

### About
- Two player chess timer.
- Clicking either player buttons toggles the timer countdown.
- When one timer reaches 0 an alert will trigger notifying you which player won.
- The reset button will reset both timers to 4:00.
- setTimeout is *slow* so when starting a new game, the timer may appear to hang, just wait. A good resource for this is John Resig's article [http://ejohn.org/blog/how-javascript-timers-work/](http://ejohn.org/blog/how-javascript-timers-work/).
